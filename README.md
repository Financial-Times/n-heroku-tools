Usage: n-heroku-tools [options] [command]

Options:
  -V, --version                                       output the version number
  -h, --help                                          output usage information

Commands:
  configure [options] [source] [target]               gets environment variables from Vault and uploads them to the current app
  deploy-static [options] <source> [otherSources...]  Deploys static <source> to S3.  Requires AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY env vars
  run [options]                                       Runs the local app through the router
  rebuild [options] [apps...]                         DEPRECATED. Trigger a rebuild of the latest master on Circle

[appName] is the package.json name (which is also the value of VAULT_NAME). On the first build of a branch, Heroku will create a review app with a build. On subsequent builds, Heroku will automatically generate a new build, which this task looks for. See https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/review-apps-beta for more details of the internals
